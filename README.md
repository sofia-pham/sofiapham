# üöÄ Portfolio Website

Welcome to my **interactive personal website**! This project showcases my skills, projects, and contact information using **React, Three.js, and React Three Fiber**. It features an interactive 3D room with a custom-designed cat character and environment. The cat moves dynamically based on user interactions, creating an engaging and immersive experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Tailwind CSS
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js, React Three Fiber
- **Animations & Effects**: React Three Fiber, React Spring
- **State Management**: React Hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **3D Modeling & Design**: Blender

## üìå How It Works

### üñ•Ô∏è Navigation

The **Navbar** provides seamless navigation across different sections of the website, including About Me, Projects, and Contact.

### üê± Cat Movement

The screen is divided into four interactive areas. Clicking on the floating bubbles moves the cat to specific areas in the 3D room, each with its own unique animation:

- **Stage 1**: Waving animation
- **Stage 2**: Typing animation
- **Stage 3**: Idling animation
- **Stage 4**: Sitting animation

### üè† 3D Environment

The 3D room is a combination of **original assets** (created in Blender) and **pre-existing assets**:

- **Custom Cat Character**: Designed and animated in Blender to fit the theme of the portfolio
- **Room Assembly**: The room layout, textures, and lighting were made, assembled, and optimized in Blender
- **Physics & Effects**: Realistic lighting, shadows, and animations powered by React Three Fiber and React Spring

#### ‚úçÔ∏è TODO

- Optimize 3D assets to shorten load time
- Detect WebGL/graphics acceleration on browsers
